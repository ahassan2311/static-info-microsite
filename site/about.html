    <h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
  At Free The Forgotten, we are committed to uplifting every member of our community through compassion, awareness, and action. Based in the vibrant heart of Church End, within the diverse borough of Brent, London, our charity works tirelessly to support individuals from all backgrounds especially those who may feel forgotten or overlooked.
</p>

<p>
  Our services include benefit and housing advice, form filling, debt advice, and guidance around employment and education. Through our dedicated tuition arm, the Zumba Education Centre, we support children and young people to reach their academic potential in a safe and focused environment.
</p>

<p>
  We offer distinct programs for youth development, including mentoring, career support, and skills-building opportunities. Alongside this, our tailored elderly support initiatives help foster connection, independence, and dignity in later life.
  Through our health and wellbeing projects, we help individuals improve both mental and physical resilience, ensuring that no one is left behind when it comes to living a healthier, more connected life.
</p>

<p>
  At Free the Forgotten, we strive to work alongside our community to shape a future where everyone feels seen, supported, and empowered.
