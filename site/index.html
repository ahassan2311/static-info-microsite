    <h2>Welcome to Free The Forgotten</h2>
    <p>Free the Forgotten, established in 2020 in Church End, Brent, London, is dedicated to empowering the local community by raising awareness on critical social issues and providing support to individuals from diverse backgrounds.
    Our mission is rooted in compassion, inclusion, and advocacy. We work tirelessly to amplify unheard voices, challenge injustice, and offer practical assistance to those facing hardship, marginalisation, or social isolation.</p> 
   <p> Through educational workshops, youth mentoring, community events, and direct aid initiatives, we aim to create a safer, stronger, and more connected community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
    Whether you're here to learn more, get involved, or seek support, we welcome you. Together, we can shine a light on those often forgotten and build a future where no one is left behind.</p>
